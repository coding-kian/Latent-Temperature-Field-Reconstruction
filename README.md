# Latent Temperature Field Reconstruction
The is a personal indepedent project exploring 2D temperature diffusion using heat equation and reconstruction from noisy (fuzzy), unreliable sensor reading using a physics based PDE model instead of modern machine learning.

## Abtract
The purpose was to understand diffusion (heat spread) and handling boundaries using numerical methods and to predict the most accurate reading when the infomation is unreliable.



## Roadmap
V2 - Advection
V3 - Humidity
